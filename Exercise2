1. Create a list of 10 delivery routes (4 marks)

routes = [

    "Mombasa-Central",
    "Nakuru-Town",
    "Eldoret-North",
    "Kisumu-Port",
    "Nyeri-South",

    "Naivasha-Lake",
    "Kericho-Green"
]
routes

2. Append a new route and remove a discontinued one (4 marks)

Let’s say we append "Busia-Border" and remove "Thika-Ridge".

routes.append("Busia-Border")     # adding new route
routes.remove("Thika-Ridge")      # removing discontinued route
routes

3. Sort the list alphabetically and reverse it (4 marks)

routes.sort()     # alphabetical
routes.reverse()  # reverse order
routes


---

4. Count how many routes start with the letter “N” (4 marks)

count_N = sum(route.startswith("N") for route in routes)
count_N

5. List comprehension: routes longer than 10 characters (4 marks)

long_routes = [route for route in routes if len(route) > 10]
.
