1. Create a dictionary with 5 products and their stock quantities (4 marks)

stock = {
    "Sugar": 15,
    "Flour": 8,
    "Rice": 20,
    "Milk": 6,
    "Bread": 12
}
stock


---

2. Add a new product and update the quantity of an existing one (4 marks)

Add "Salt": 18 and update "Milk" to quantity 10.

stock["Salt"] = 18        # adding new product
stock["Milk"] = 10        # updating existing product
stock


---

3. Write a function to return products with stock less than 10 (4 marks)

def low_stock_items(stock_dict):
    return [product for product, qty in stock_dict.items() if qty < 10]

low_stock_items(stock)


---

4. Delete a discontinued product and display updated dictionary (4 marks)

Let’s remove "Bread".

del stock["Bread"]
stock


---

5. Use .items() to loop and print each product with its quantity (4 marks)

for product, qty in stock.items():
    print(product, ":", qty)
