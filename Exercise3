1. Create a tuple for a patient (4 marks)

Tuple format: (Name, Age, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate)

patient = ("John Doe", 45, "120/80", 76)
patient


---

2. Access and print the patient’s age and heart rate (4 marks)

age = patient[1]
heart_rate = patient[3]

print("Age:", age)
print("Heart Rate:", heart_rate)

3. Why tuples are suitable for storing patient vitals? (4 marks)

Tuples are suitable because:

They are immutable, meaning the data cannot be accidentally changed.

This protects critical health information from unintentional modification.

They keep related data together in a fixed, structured format.

Faster to access compared to lists because of immutability.


Therefore, tuples are ideal for storing fixed records like patient vitals.

4. Convert tuple to list, update heart rate, convert back to tuple (4 marks)

patient_list = list(patient)
patient_list[3] = 80     # updating heart rate
patient = tuple(patient_list)

patient

5. Create a tuple of 5 patients and extract all names (4 marks)

patients = (
    ("John Doe", 45, "120/80", 76),
    ("Mary Anne", 39, "118/77", 82),
    ("Kevin Otieno", 50, "130/85", 70),
    ("Sarah Kim", 29, "115/75", 78),
    ("Brian Kip", 60, "140/90", 72)
)

# Extracting all names
names = [p[0] for p in patients]
names
